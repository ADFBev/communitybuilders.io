Roberto Faria is the Competitions Marketing Manager at Shopify and the co-founder of the Account Planning Group of Canada.  
  
His passion for connecting people led him to build the APGCanada, a community for Brand Planners and Strategists from all over the country. The initiative is now backed by some of Canada's most prominent advertising agencies and professionals, becoming a reference within the industry.  
  
Among other things, he will be helping in bringing the Community Builders together in real life through regular events.  
  
Roberto tries really hard to clearly vocalize the "L" when saying the word "clock" in a professional-related context. He has missed it only once.
