My name is Stefan Palios - I'm a small town born and raised guy who got lucky enough to live and work in cities around the world while I was in university. Now I'm in Toronto working in global development for HackerNest, a global tech community.  
  
I thrive on knowing there are communities of people just like me. Not in every way, perhaps, but that there are communities where I can engage with different parts of my personality, learn about a new world, meet new people, and explore my own intellect while making new friends.  
  
Community building to me is more than getting people in a room, it's about making people feel comfortable with who they are in that space. As a queer person, this thought has been on my mind for many years. Having a community of community builders (aka let's get the people in the room who actually plan the things) is exciting because it speaks to opportunity, to achieving more than we could apart, and to giving opportunities to a group of people who are such hard workers.  
  
I'm using the Community Builders group as an opportunity to learn more about community building from the amazing people who do it every day. Since I work in development, my job is to better understand the process of community building so I can do a better job of bringing in corporate partners. That being said, I'm also an eager event volunteer, moderator, and strategic type.  
  
I had a nearly 10 year career in my youth throwing shot put and discus; I've won the national title in shot put twice and broken a few provincial records in both shot put and discus.
