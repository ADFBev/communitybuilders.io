## Community Builders Code of Conduct

##### Who is this group for:

It's simple, this slack is **a curated group made by community builders for community builders**. You must be a community builder to join. It is for community builders to learn from each other first and foremost. 

We assume everyone in our community is intelligent and well meaning. We will not tell you what to do, however there are a few things that this group requires in order for it to operate at full value to its members:

- **No spamming.** We encourage participation in authentic way. This way you help contribute to the health and longevity of the group.
- **We do not tolerate disrespectful behaviour** towards other members of the community, this includes demeaning, discriminatory or harassing messages. Exercise consideration. Basically: “Don't be that guy (or girl)”.
- **Attempt collaboration before conflict.** No one is perfect, but let's try to understand why we disagree first. Learning to de-escalate a hostile situation is a life skill, let's practice some of it here. 
- **Don't keep silent if you observe hurtful behaviour.** One can only try and fix what one is aware of. Please report your concerns to [communitybuildersio@gmail.com](mailto:communitybuildersio@gmail.com). All reports will be handled with discretion. 


##### In short:

> Community Builders are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, technological choices, and religion (or lack thereof).
> Community Builders reserves the right to ban those that do not follow the basic tenants of this code of conduct after fair warning and prior discussion with moderators.
